<brief><content-text><![CDATA[The diagram depicts Frame Relay subinterfaces, point-to-point and multipoint.<br><br>Network Topology:<br>The diagram shows four routers, R1, R2, R3, and R4. Router R1 has a single physical interface S0 and two subinterfaces, S0.1 and S0.2. Connections from R1 to the other three routers are as follows.<br><br>Point-to-Point Subinterface:<br>R1 logical interface S0.1 connects to R2 using the point-to-point subinterface.<br><br>Point-to-point subinterfaces - In hub and spoke topologies:<br>- Subinterfaces act as leased lines.<br>- Each point-to-point subinterface requires its own subnet.<br><br>Multipoint Subinterface:<br>R1 logical interface S0.1 and S0.2 connects to R2 and R3, respectively, using multipoint subinterfaces.<br><br>Multipoint subinterfaces - In partial-mesh and full-mesh topologies:<br>- Subinterfaces act as non-broadcast multi-access (NBMA), so they do not resolve the split horizon issue.<br>- Can save address space because it uses a single subnet.<br>]]></content-text></brief>
