<brief><content-text><![CDATA[The diagram depicts the split horizon rule.<br><br>Network Topology:<br>The diagram shows a full mesh Frame Relay network with three routers: R1, R2, and R3. Each router connects to the 10.1.1.0 /24 network through the Frame Relay cloud using its Serial 0/0/0 interface.<br><br>Router IP Addressing:<br>Router R1 S0/0/0 IP Address: 10.1.1.1 /24<br>Router R2 S0/0/0 IP Address: 10.1.1.2 /24<br>Router R3 S0/0/0 IP Address: 10.1.1.3 /24<br><br>Frame Relay DLCI's:<br>R1 to R2: DLCI 102<br>R1 to R3: DLCI 103<br>R2 to R1: DLCI 201<br>R2 to R3: DLCI 203<br>R3 to R1: DLCI 301<br>R3 to R2: DLCI 302<br><br>Split Horizon Rule:<br>The diagram shows R2, a spoke router, sending a broadcast routing update to R1, the hub router. Routing updates are sent by R2 out interface S0/0/0 to both R1 and R3.<br><br>Problem: The update received on the physical interface is not transmitted out the same interface. <br><br>Split Horizon Problem:<br>Routing updates need to be sent by R1 out its S0/0/0 interface to R3. R1 has multiple PVC's on a single physical interface, so the split horizon rule prevents R1 from forwarding that routing update through the same physical interface to other remote spoke routers (R3).<br><br>Problem: Broadcast traffic must be replicated ro each active connection.<br>]]></content-text></brief>
