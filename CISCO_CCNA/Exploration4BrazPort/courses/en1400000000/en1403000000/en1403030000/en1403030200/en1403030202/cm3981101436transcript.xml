<brief><content-text><![CDATA[The diagram depicts Frame Relay bursting concepts. <br><br>C B I R and B E:<br>The network topology is the same as 3.3.1 Diagram One.<br><br>Table One lists Committed Information Rate (C I R), Committed Burst Information Rate (C B I R), and Excess Burst (B E):<br>PVC DCLI = 102.<br>C I R (Normal) = 32 kbps.<br>C B I R (Example) = 48 kbps.<br>B E = 16 kbps.<br><br>PVC DCLI = 103.<br>C I R (Normal) = 16 kbps.<br>C B I R (Example) = 0 kbps.<br>B E = 48 kbps.<br><br>Notes:<br>C I R: All frames are forwarded.<br>C B I R = Frames are forwarded but marked D E.<br>B E = Frames most likely dropped.<br><br>Frame Relay Bursting:<br>The diagram shows a chart with time on the X-axis and transmission rate on the Y-axis. The increments on the Y-axis are 0 kbps, 32 kbps, 48 kbps, and 64 kbps (the maximum local loop access rate). The range from 0 kbps to 32 kbps is labeled C I R (32 kbps). The range from 32 kbps to 48 kbps is labeled C B I R (16 kbps), and the range from 48 kbps to 64 kbps is labeled B E (16 kbps).<br><br>The transmission rate starts at zero and increases to above 32 kbps for a period and then drops below 32 kbps. Frames in the range where the transmission rate is above 32 kbps (and potentially up to 64 kbps) have a D E bit set.<br>]]></content-text></brief>
