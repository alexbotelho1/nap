<brief><content-text><![CDATA[The diagram depicts a standard Frame Relay frame and the concepts of frame queuing and congestion control.<br><br>Frame Format:<br>The Frame Relay frame contains the following fields from left to right. <br>Flag = 8 bits.<br>Address = 16 bits.<br>Data = Variable.<br>FCS = 16 bits.<br>Flag = 8 bits.<br><br>The header Address field is a 2-byte field and is expanded in the diagram to show the following:<br><br>Byte One:<br>DLCI = 6 bits (First 6 bits of the 10-bit DLCI).<br>C / R = 1 bit.<br>E A = 1 bit.<br><br>Byte Two:<br>DLCI = 4 Bits (Last 4 bits of the 10-bit DLCI).<br>FECN = 1 bit.<br>BECN = 1 bit.<br>D E = 1 bit.<br>E A = 1 bit.<br><br>Queuing:<br>The animation shows Frame Relay bandwidth control using queuing.<br><br>Network Topology:<br>There are two routers connected to a single Frame Relay switch. The Frame Relay switch is connected to Frame Relay switch A interface 0 in the cloud. Switch A interface 1 is connected to another Frame Relay switch in the cloud. Switch A has a box labeled Queue to hold frames for later transmission when congestion occurs.<br><br>The animation progresses:<br>While switch A is putting a large frame on interface 1, other frames for this interface are queued.<br>Downstream devices are warned of the queue by setting the FECN bit. <br>Upstream devices are warned of the queue by setting the BECN bit, even though they may not have contributed to the congestion.<br>]]></content-text></brief>
