<brief><content-text><![CDATA[The diagram depicts the Frame Relay encapsulation process and frame format.<br><br>Encapsulation:<br>An IP packet (for example a web request) at Layer 3 is encapsulated into a Frame Relay frame at Data Link Layer 2. The frame includes an address field that contains the DLCI and a checksum. Flag fields are added to indicate the beginning and end of the frame. The flags are represented either as the hexadecimal number 7E or as the binary number 01111110. <br><br>Frame Format:<br>The Frame Relay frame contains the following fields from left to right. <br>Flag = 8 bits.<br>Address = 16 bits.<br>Data = Variable.<br>FCS = 16 bits.<br>Flag = 8 bits.<br><br>The two-byte header Address field is expanded in the diagram to show the following:<br><br>Byte One:<br>DLCI = 6 bits (First 6 bits of the 10-bit DLCI).<br>C/R = 1 bit.<br>E A = 1 bit.<br><br>Byte Two:<br>DLCI = 4 Bits (Last 4 bits of the 10-bit DLCI).<br>FECN = 1 bit.<br>BECN = 1 bit.<br>D E = 1 bit.<br>E A = 1 bit.]]></content-text></brief>
