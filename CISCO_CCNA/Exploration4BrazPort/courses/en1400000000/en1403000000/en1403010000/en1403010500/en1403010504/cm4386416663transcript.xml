<brief><content-text><![CDATA[The diagram depicts the process of using LMI and inverse ARP to map addresses.<br><br>Network Topology:<br>A group of switches are interconnected in a Frame Relay cloud. Five routers are shown, each connected to a Frame Relay switch at the edge of the cloud. The router labeled R1 does not show a DLCI number. The other four routers have DLCI's 101, 102, 103, and 104 associated with them.<br><br>LMI Animation One:<br>One. D T E sends Status Enquiry Message (75) to DCE.<br>Two. DCE responds with Status Message (7 D) - includes configured DLCI's.<br>Three. D T E learns what VC's it has.<br><br>The Frame Relay switch reports back to router R1 that DLCI's 101, 102, 103, and 104 are active.<br><br>LMI Animation Two: <br>One. D T E R1 sends inverse ARP on a VC, mapping the VC to the network address.<br>Two. Remote D T E DLCI 101 replies with the Layer 3 address 172.16.0.1.<br>Three. D T E R1 maps Layer 2 to Layer 3.<br><br>The process is repeated for each VC and each Layer 3 protocol.<br>]]></content-text></brief>
