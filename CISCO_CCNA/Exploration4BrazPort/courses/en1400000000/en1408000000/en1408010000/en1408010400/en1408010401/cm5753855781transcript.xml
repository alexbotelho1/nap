These include selecting which data to measure, identifying the devices and ports of interest, and determining the baseline duration.<br><br>Selecting Which Data to Measure:<br>The diagram shows a screenshot of server interface, CPU, and disk utilization data as displayed by a Fluke Networks network management system.<br><br>Devices and Ports of Interest:<br>The diagram shows a network with PC's, switches, routers, servers, network clouds, and connection links.<br><br>Devices and Ports of Interest include the following:<br>-	Router to router ports<br>-	Router to switch ports<br>-	Router port to Web/TFTP server<br>-	PC1 (Admin User)<br>-	SRV1 (Web/TFTP server)<br><br>Determining Baseline Duration:<br>The diagram shows several screenshots of CPU utilization trends captured over various time periods. Examples include:<br>-	Daily Graph (5 minute average)<br>-	Weekly Graph (30 minute average)<br>-	Monthly Graph (2 hour average)<br>-	Yearly Graph (1 day average)<br><br>In each graph, max load, average load, and current load are listed.<br>]]></content-text></brief>
