<brief><content-text><![CDATA[The diagram depicts a flowchart that describes the network documentation process for devices:<br>-	Login enables you to log in to an undocumented device. Login leads you to interface discovery. Interface discovery allows you to discover relevant information about the device. Interface discovery leads you to a document allowing you to record device information in the network configuration table. This leads to a series of questions.<br>-	Is it a component of the topology diagram? In other words, is this device information important to add to the topology diagram?<br>-	If yes, diagram it and transfer the relevant information.<br>-	If no, has the device been completely documented?<br>-	If yes, perform device discovery to determine what other devices are connected to this one.<br>-	If no, continue with interface discovery.<br>-	Were any devices determined to be undocumented?<br>-	If yes, continue with interface discovery.<br>-	If no, the network documentation is complete.<br>]]></content-text></brief>
