<brief><content-text><![CDATA[The diagram depicts ways of documenting your network, which include router and switch documentation, end-system documentation, and a network topology diagram.<br><br>Router and Switch Documentation:<br>The diagram shows a router information table that documents the following. A sample entry is provided:<br>-	Device Name and Model: R1, Cisco 2611XM<br>-	Interface Name: FA0/0<br>-	MAC Address: 0007.8580.a159<br>-	IP Address/Subnet Mask: 192.168.10.1/24<br>-	IP Routing Protocol: EIGRP 10<br><br>The diagram also shows a switch information table that documents the following. A sample entry is provided:<br>-	Switch Name, Model and Management IP Address: S1, Cisco WS-C3550-24-SMI, 192.168.10.2/24<br>-	Port Name: FA0/1<br>-	Speed: 100<br>-	Duplex: Auto<br>-	STP State (Forward/Block): Forward<br>-	Port Fast (Yes/No): No<br>-	Trunk Status: On<br>-	Ether Channel (L2 or L3): L2<br>-	V LAN's: 1<br>-	Key: Connects to R1<br><br>End-System Documentation:<br>The diagram shows an end-system information table that documents the following. A sample entry is provided:<br>-	Device Name (Purpose): SRV1 (Web/TFTP Server)<br>-	Operating System/ Version: UNIX<br>-	IP Address/ Subnet Mask: 192.168.20.254/24<br>-	Default Gateway Address: 192.168.20.1/24<br>-	DNS Server Address: 192.168.20.1/24<br>-	WINS Server Address: <br>-	Network Applications: HTTP FTP<br>-	High Bandwidth Applications: V o IP<br><br>Network Topology Diagram:<br>The diagram shows a graphical representation of a network, which illustrates how each device in a network is connected and its logical architecture. Each network device is represented on the diagram by an icon. These include PC's, switches, routers, servers, and network clouds, and connection links. Device names, interface names, IP address and subnet mask labels are applied. <br>]]></content-text></brief>
