<brief><content-text><![CDATA[The diagram depicts various common WAN topologies, such as star, full mesh, partial mesh, and hierarchical.<br><br>Star Topology:<br>The diagram shows a central router, labeled Paris, with four other routers connected to it labeled Brussels, Berlin, Vienna, and Rome.<br><br>Full Mesh Topology:<br>The diagram shows five routers labeled Paris, Brussels, Berlin, Vienna, and Rome. Each router has a WAN connection to every other router.<br><br>Partial Mesh Topology:<br>The diagram shows five routers labeled Paris, Brussels, Berlin, Vienna, and Rome. Each router has a WAN connection to at least two other routers, but only Paris has a WAN connection to every other router.<br><br>Hierarchical Topology:<br>The diagram shows a central router connected to a WAN backbone. Four other routers are connected to it by WAN links. Each of these four routers has six routers connected to it with WAN links.<br>]]></content-text></brief>
