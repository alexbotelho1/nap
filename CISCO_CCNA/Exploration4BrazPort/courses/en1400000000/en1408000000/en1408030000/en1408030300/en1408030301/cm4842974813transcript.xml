<brief><content-text><![CDATA[The diagram lists traffic types and traffic considerations.<br><br>Traffic Types: <br>Traffic: Voice<br>Latency: Low<br>Jitter: Low<br>Bandwidth: Medium<br><br>Traffic: Transaction data (for example, S N A)<br>Latency: Medium<br>Jitter: Medium<br>Bandwidth: Medium<br><br>Traffic: Messaging (e-mail)<br>Latency: High<br>Jitter: High<br>Bandwidth: High<br><br>Traffic: File transfer<br>Latency: High<br>Jitter: High<br>Bandwidth: High<br><br>Traffic: Batch data<br>Latency: High<br>Jitter: High<br>Bandwidth: High<br><br>Traffic: Network management<br>Latency: High<br>Jitter: High<br>Bandwidth: Low<br><br>Traffic: Videoconferencing<br>Latency: Low<br>Jitter: Low<br>Bandwidth: High<br><br>Traffic Characteristics: <br><br>Characteristic: Connectivity and volume flows<br>Description: Where does this traffic flow and how much traffic flows there?<br><br>Characteristic: Client/server data<br>Description: What kind of traffic flows between the client and server?<br><br>Characteristic: Latency tolerance, including length and variability<br>Description: Can the users tolerate delays? How much and how often?<br><br>Characteristic: Network availability tolerance<br>Description: How critical is network availability to the users of this LAN?<br>Can they tolerate WAN outages or would their work grind to a halt?<br><br>Characteristic: Error-rate tolerance<br>Description: Is this noisy traffic?<br><br>Characteristic: Priority<br>Description: Does this traffic have priority over other traffic?<br>For example, network management messages should have a higher priority than e-mail.<br><br>Characteristic: Protocol type<br>Description: What types of protocols operate within the network?<br><br>Characteristic: Average packet length<br>Description: What is the average size of packets being transmitted?<br>]]></content-text></brief>
