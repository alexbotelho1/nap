<brief><content-text><![CDATA[The diagram depicts the process of troubleshooting Layer 2 Frame Relay problems. A series of steps is provided with a network topology, and output from show commands is displayed.<br><br>Network Topology:<br>Router R2 interface S0/0/1 is connected to a CSU/DSU, which is connected to a Frame Relay provider cloud. On the other side of the diagram, router R3 interface S0/0/1 is connected to a CSU/DSU that is connected to the same Frame Relay cloud as R1.<br><br>Step 1. Verify the physical connection between the CSU/DSU and the router. In the diagram, the physical connections between routers R2 and R3 and their corresponding CSU/DSU can be verified using a cable tester and by verifying that all status L E D's on the CSU/DSU unit are green. Some of the status lights for the CSU/DSU at R3 are red, indicating a potential connectivity problem between the CSU/DSU and router R3.<br><br>Step 2. Verify that the router and Frame Relay provider are properly exchanging LMI information by using the show frame-relay lmi command. Output from this command on R2 indicates no errors and that R2 and the Frame Relay provider switch are properly exchanging LMI information. The number of status requests is equal to the number of status messages received.<br><br>Step 3. Verify that the PVC status is active by using the show frame-relay pvc command. Output from this command on R2 indicates PVC status is active. <br><br>Step 4. Verify that the Frame Relay encapsulation matches on both routers with the show interfaces serial command. Output from this command on R2 indicates that encapsulation is Frame Relay, but encapsulation on R3 is HDLC, which is a mismatch.<br>]]></content-text></brief>
