<brief><content-text><![CDATA[The diagram depicts the process of troubleshooting Layer 2 P P P problems. A series of steps is provided with a network topology, and output from show commands is displayed.<br><br>Network Topology:<br>Router R1 interface S0/0/0 is connected to a CSU/DSU that is connected to a P P P cloud. On the other side of the diagram, router R2 interface S0/0/0 is connected to a CSU/DSU that is connected to the same P P P cloud as R1.<br><br>Step 1. Check that the appropriate encapsulation is in use at both ends. Output from the show interfaces serial 0/0/0 command on R2 indicates HDLC encapsulation, which is a problem because it should be P P P.<br><br>Step 2. Confirm that the Link Control Protocol (LCP) negotiations have succeeded. After correcting the S0/0/0 encapsulation to P P P, the output from the show interfaces serial 0/0/0 command on R2 indicates P P P encapsulation and that LCP is now open and negotiations have succeeded.<br><br>Step 3. Verify authentication on both sides of the link using the debug p p p authentication command. Output from this command on R1 indicates that username R2 is not found, and that R1 is unable to authenticate R2 using CHAP, because the username and password for R2 have not been configured on R1.<br>]]></content-text></brief>
