<brief><content-text><![CDATA[The animation depicts a comparison between serial and parallel communications. Issues associated with parallel communications, such as clock skew and interference, are also illustrated. <br><br>Serial and Parallel Communications:<br>The animation shows serial communications, which transmits a single bit at a time, and parallel communications, which transmits eight bits (one byte) at a time.<br><br>Clock Skew:<br>The animation shows serial communications, which transmits a single bit at a time, and parallel communications, which transmits eight bits (one byte) at a time. However, in this animation, the eight parallel bits are offset or skewed and do not all arrive at the same time. The receiving end must synchronize itself with the transmitter and then wait until all the bits have arrived.<br><br>Interference:<br>The animation shows serial communications, which transmits a single bit at a time, and parallel communications, which transmits eight bits (one byte) at a time. However, in this animation, some of the eight parallel bits are dropped, especially at higher frequencies, due to crosstalk. Thus the byte is lost due because of data corruption.<br>]]></content-text></brief>
