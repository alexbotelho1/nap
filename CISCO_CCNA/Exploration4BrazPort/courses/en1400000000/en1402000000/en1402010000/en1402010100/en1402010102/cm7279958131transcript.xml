<brief><content-text><![CDATA[The diagram depicts the serial communication process across a WAN link. The 9-pin RS-232 serial connector and pins are also described.<br><br>Serial Communication Process:<br>A PC on one side of the WAN cloud is sending data that is to be encapsulated to the router. The data is encapsulated by the communications protocol used by the router. The router sends the encapsulated frame across the serial WAN link (physical medium) as a string of zeros and ones. At the receiving end, a router uses the same communications protocol to de-encapsulate the frame. The unencapsulated data is then sent to another PC.<br><br>RS-232 serial connector:<br>The diagram shows a 9-pin D-type RS-232 serial connector with a table listing each, an abbreviation of its signal, and a description of what the pin does.<br><br>Pin: One.<br>Signal: DCD.<br>Description: Data carrier detect.<br><br>Pin: Two.<br>Signal: RxD.<br>Description: Receive data.<br><br>Pin: Three.<br>Signal: TxD.<br>Description: Transmit data.<br><br>Pin: Four.<br>Signal: DTR.<br>Description: Data terminal ready.<br><br>Pin: Five.<br>Signal: GND.<br>Description: Signal ground.<br><br>Pin: Six.<br>Signal: DSR.<br>Description: Data set ready.<br><br>Pin: Seven.<br>Signal: RTS.<br>Description: Request to send.<br><br>Pin: Eight.<br>Signal: CTS.<br>Description: Clear to send.<br><br>Pin: Nine.<br>Signal: R I.<br>Description: Ring indicator.]]></content-text></brief>
