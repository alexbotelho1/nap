<brief><content-text><![CDATA[The diagram depicts P P P frame structure and field information for an LCP packet. The fields in the frame are from left to right:<br><br>Flag: One byte that indicates the beginning or end of a frame and consists of the binary sequence 01111110 to identify a P P P frame. The value is set to 0 x 7 E (bit sequence 01111110) to signify the start and end of a P P P frame. In successive P P P frames, only a single flag character is used.<br><br>Address: One byte that consists of the standard broadcast address, which is the binary sequence 11111111. P P P does not assign individual station addresses. In HDLC environments, the Address field is used to address the frame to the destination node. On a point-to-point link, the destination node does not need to be addressed. Therefore, for P P P, the Address field is set to 0 x F F, the broadcast address. If both P P P peers agree to perform address and control field compression during LCP negotiation, the Address field is not included.<br><br>Control: One byte that consists of the binary sequence 00000011, which calls for transmission of user data in an unsequenced frame. This provides a connectionless link service that does not require you to establish data links or link stations. <br><br>Protocol: Two bytes that identify the protocol encapsulated in the data field of the frame. The 2-byte Protocol ID field identifies the protocol of the P P P payload. If both P P P peers agree to perform protocol field compression during LCP negotiation, the Protocol ID field is one byte for Protocol ID's in the range of 0 x 00-00 to 0 x 00-F F.<br><br>Data: Zero or more bytes that contain the datagram for the protocol specified in the protocol field. The 2 bytes of the frame check sequence (FCS) field, followed by the closing flag, marks the end of the data field. The default maximum length of the data field is 1500 bytes.<br><br>FCS: Two or four bytes that use a16-bit checksum to check for bit-level errors in the P P P frame. If the receiver's calculation of the FCS does not match the FCS in the P P P frame, the P P P frame is silently discarded. By prior agreement, consenting P P P implementations can use a 32-bit (4-byte) FCS for improved error detection.<br>]]></content-text></brief>
