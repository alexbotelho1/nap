<brief><content-text><![CDATA[This is a review and is not a quiz. Questions and answers are provided. <br>Question One. Describe four of the six types of WAN encapsulation protocols. <br>Answer:<br>HDLC - The default encapsulation type on point-to-point connections, dedicated links, and circuit-switched connections when the link uses two Cisco devices.<br><br>P P P - Provides router-to-router and host-to-network connections over synchronous and asynchronous circuits. P P P works with several Network Layer protocols, such as IP and IPX. P P P also has built-in security mechanisms, such as PAP and CHAP.<br><br>Serial Line Internet Protocol (SLIP) - A standard protocol for point-to-point serial connections using TCP/IP. SLIP has been largely displaced by P P P.<br><br>X.25/Link Access Procedure, Balanced (LAPB) - I T U-T standard that defines how connections between a D T E and DCE are maintained for remote terminal access and computer communications in public data networks. X.25 specifies LAPB, a Data Link Layer protocol. X.25 is a predecessor to Frame Relay.<br><br>Frame Relay - Industry-standard, switched, Data Link Layer protocol that handles multiple virtual circuits. Frame Relay is a next-generation protocol after X.25. Frame Relay eliminates some of the time-consuming processes, such as error correction and flow control, employed in X.25.<br><br>ATM - The international standard for cell relay in which devices send multiple service types (such as voice, video, or data) in fixed-length (53 byte) cells. Fixed-length cells allow processing to occur in hardware, thereby reducing transit delays. ATM takes advantages of high-speed transmission media such as E3, SONET, and T3.<br><br>Question Two. <br>Describe the functions of LCP and NCP. <br>Answer:<br>Link Control Protocol (LCP) Layer:<br>- Sits on top of the Physical Layer and has a role in establishing, configuring, and testing the data-link connection.<br>- Establishes the point-to-point link.<br>- Provides automatic configuration of the interfaces at each end, including handling varying limits on packet size, detecting common misconfiguration errors, terminating the link, and determining when a link is functioning properly or when it is failing.<br>- Is also used to negotiate authentication, compression, error detection, multilink, and P P P callback after the link is established.<br>- Negotiates and sets up control options on the WAN data link, which are handled by the NCP's.<br><br>Network Control Protocol (NCP) Layer:<br>- Includes functional fields containing standardized codes to indicate the Network Layer protocol that P P P encapsulates.<br>- Handles the assignment and management of IP addresses in IPCP.<br>- Encapsulates and negotiates options for multiple Network Layer protocols.<br><br>Question Three. <br>Describe the five configurable LCP encapsulation options.<br>Answer:<br>Authentication using PAP or CHAP<br>- If all you need is password authentication, configure PAP using the p p p authentication pap command.<br>- If you want a challenge handshake, configure CHAP using the p p p authentication chap command, which is more secure.<br><br>Compression<br>- Increases the effective throughput by reducing the amount of data in the P P P frame that must travel across the link.<br>- To configure Stacker, use the compress stac command. To configure Predictor, use the compress predictor command.<br><br>Error Detection<br>- Identifies fault conditions to help ensure a reliable, loop-free data link.<br>- Configured using the p p p quality number 1-100 command.<br><br>Multilink<br>- Provides load balancing over the router interfaces that P P P uses using the command p p p multilink.<br><br>P P P Callback<br>- Enhances security by making a Cisco router a callback client, which makes the initial call, requests that the other Cisco router configured as a server call it back, and terminates its initial call.<br>- The command is p p p callback [accept | request].<br><br>Question Four. <br>Refer to the running configuration output shown below for R1 and R3. R1 and R3 are unable to establish a P P P session using authentication. Which configuration changes on router R1 would correct the problem?<br><br>Router R1 running config:<br>hostname R1<br>username R1 password Cisco<br>!<br>interface serial 0/0/0<br>i p address 10.3.3.1  255.255.255.252<br>encapsulation p p p<br>p p p authentication pap<br><br>Router R3 running config:<br>hostname R3<br>username R1 password cisco<br>!<br>interface serial 0/0/0<br>i p address 10.3.3.2  255.255.255.252<br>encapsulation p p p<br>p p p authentication chap<br><br>Answer:<br>On router R1, the username command has two errors. The router name should be R3, and the password should be cisco (lowercase). The correct command is username R3 password cisco.<br><br>The third error is in the p p p authentication command. It should be p p p authentication chap.<br>]]></content-text></brief>
