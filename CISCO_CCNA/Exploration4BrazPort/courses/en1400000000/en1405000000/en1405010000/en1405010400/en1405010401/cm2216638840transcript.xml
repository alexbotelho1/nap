<brief><content-text><![CDATA[The diagram depicts flowcharts that illustrate how inbound and outbound ACL's work.<br><br>Inbound ACL's:<br>- A block labeled "Packets to interfaces in the access group" starts the flowchart. <br>- The packet then goes through a series of tests to see if it matches those tests.<br>- If the packet does not match the first test, it goes to the second test.<br>- If it fails to match any of the tests, it is implicitly denied and discarded.<br>- If it matches one of the tests, the next decision is whether it is to be permitted or denied.<br>- If permitted, the packet is allowed to pass to the destination interface.<br>- If denied, the packet is discarded.<br><br>Outbound ACL's:<br>- An arrow labeled "Inbound Interface Packets" starts the flowchart.<br>- A decision is made based on whether there is a routing table entry for the destination address.<br>- If there is an entry, the packet is forwarded to the outbound interface. <br>- If there is no entry, the packet is discarded.<br>- If there is no ACL on the outbound interface, the packet is sent to its destination.<br>- If there is an ACL on the outbound interface, the packet goes through a series of tests to see if it matches those tests.<br>- If it fails to match any of the tests, it is implicitly denied and discarded.<br>- If it matches one of the tests, the next decision is whether it is to be permitted or denied.<br>- If permitted, the packet is allowed to pass trough the outbound interface.<br>- If denied, the packet is discarded.]]></content-text></brief>
