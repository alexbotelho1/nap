<brief><content-text><![CDATA[The diagram depicts a network and the placement of standard and extended ACL's.<br><br>Network Topology:<br>There are three LAN's with switches S1, S2, and S3. PC1, PC2, and PC3 are interconnected by routers R1, R2, and R3. The R1 LAN is 192.168.10.0/24, and the R3 LAN is 192.168.30.0/24.<br>- PC1 is connected to switch S1, which is connected to router R1 on its FA0/1 interface.<br>- PC2 is connected to switch S2, which is connected to router R2 on its FA0/2 interface.<br>- PC3 is connected to switch S3, which is connected to router R3 on its FA0/1 interface.<br>- Router R1 S0/0/0 WAN interface is connected to router R2 S0/0/0.<br>- Router R3 S0/0/1 WAN interface is connected to router R2 S0/0/1.<br><br>Standard ACL:<br>A bubble points to R3 interface S0/0/1 that states: Standard ACL 99 to block any traffic from R1.<br><br>Extended ACL:<br>A bubble points to R1 interface FA0/2 that states: Extended ACL 102 to stop Telnet and FTP traffic from leaving this network.<br>]]></content-text></brief>
