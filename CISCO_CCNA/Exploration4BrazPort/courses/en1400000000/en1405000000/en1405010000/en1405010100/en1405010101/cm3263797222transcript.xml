<brief><content-text><![CDATA[The animation depicts a TCP conversation and TCP/UDP port number ranges. <br><br>A TCP conversation:<br>In the animation, a client PC initiates a TCP conversation with a server. As the animation progresses, arrows pass between the client and server illustrating the process.<br>A TCP SYN packet is initially sent from the client PC to the server. The conversation goes as follows:<br><br>Client PC: "Let's talk." - TCP SYN packet<br>Server: "Sure, let's talk." - TCP SYN/ACK packet<br>Client PC: "Great, we have a connection." - TCP ACK packet<br>Client PC: "I need you to send me some data." - TCP data segment<br>Server: "Thanks, I received your request." - TCP ACK packet<br>Server: "Here is the data you want." - TCP data segments<br>Client PC: "Thanks. I received my data." - TCP ACK packet<br>Server: "I am finished and have no more data to send." - TCP FIN/ACK packet<br>Client PC: "I am finished as well. Thanks." - TCP FIN/ACK packet<br><br>TCP/UDP Port Numbers:<br>Port Number Range: 0 to 1023<br>Port Group: Well Known (common) Ports<br>Well Known TCP Port examples:<br>- 21 - FTP<br>- 23 - Telnet<br>- 25 - SMTP<br>- 80 - HTTP<br>- 110 - POP3<br>- 194 - Internet Relay Chat (I RC)<br>- 443 - Secure HTTP (HTTPS)<br>Well Known UDP Port examples:<br>- 69 - TFTP<br>- 520 - RIP<br>Well Known TCP/UDP Common Port examples:<br>- 53 - DNS<br>- 161 - SNMP<br>- 531 - A O L Instant Messenger, I RC<br><br>Port Number Range: 1024 to 49151<br>Port Group: Registered Ports<br>Registered TCP Port examples:<br>- 1863 - MSN Messenger<br>- 8008 - Alternate HTTP<br>- 8080 - Alternate HTTP<br><br>Registered UDP Port examples: <br>- 1812 - RADIUS Authentication Protocol<br>- 2000 - Cisco SCCP (V o IP)<br>- 5004 - RTP (Voice and Video Transport Protocol)<br>- 5060 - SIP (V o IP)<br><br>Registered TCP/UDP Common Port examples:<br>- 1433 - MSSQL<br>- 2948 - WAP (MMS)<br><br>Port Number Range: 49152 to 65535<br>Port Group: Private and Dynamic Ports]]></content-text></brief>
