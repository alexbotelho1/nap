PC2 and switch S2 connect to the R1 interface F0/1. The R1 interface S0/0/0 is connected to R2 via a WAN link. R2 is connected to a server. A third LAN, with PC3 and switch S3, is connected to R3, which is also connected to R2 via a WAN link.<br><br>A clock is shown with the time of 7:00 p.m. The connection from S1 to R1 has a red X on it indicating that access to R1 is not allowed at this time.<br><br>Time-based ACL's allow for access control based on the time of day and week.<br>]]></content-text></brief>
