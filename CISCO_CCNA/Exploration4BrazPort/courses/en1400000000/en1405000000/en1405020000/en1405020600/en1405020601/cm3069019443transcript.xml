<brief><content-text><![CDATA[The diagram depicts standard ACL configuration procedures and topology examples. <br><br>Syntax:<br>Router(config)#i p access-list [standard | extended] name<br><br>- Alphanumeric name string must be unique and cannot begin with a number.<br><br>Router(config-std-n a c l)# [permit | deny | remark] {source [source-wildcard]} [log]<br><br>- If not configured, sequence numbers are generated automatically, starting at 10 and incrementing by 10.<br>- No sequence number removes the specific test from the named ACL.<br><br>Router(config-i f)#i p access-group name [in | out]<br><br>- Activates the named IP ACL on an interface.<br><br>Example: <br>Network Topology:<br>There are two LAN's with switches S1 and S2. PC1 and PC2 are interconnected by router R1. The S1 LAN is 192.168.10.0/24, and the S2 LAN is 192.168.11.0/24.<br>- PC1 with IP address 192.168.10.10/24 is connected to switch S1, which is connected to router R1 on its FA0/0 interface.<br>- PC2 with IP address 192.168.11.10/24 is connected to switch S2, which is connected to router R1 on its FA0/1 interface.<br>- R1 interface S0/0/0 is connected to network 10.1.1.0/30.<br><br>Commands to configure and apply a standard named ACL:<br>R1(config)#i p access-list standard No_ACCESS<br>R1(config-std-n a c l)#deny host 192.168.11.10<br>R1(config-std-n a c l)#permit 192.168.11.0 0.0.0.255<br>R1(config-std-n a c l)#interface FA0/0<br>R1(config-i f)#i p access-group No_ACCESS out]]></content-text></brief>
