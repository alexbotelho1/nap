<brief><content-text><![CDATA[The diagram depicts a specific standard ACL example and a flowchart indicating the logic that the ACL applies to incoming packets.<br><br>Packets that come in FA0/0 are checked for their source addresses using the following ACL statements:<br><br>Statement One: access-list 2 deny 192.168.10.1<br>Effect: If the source address is from host 192.168.10.1, deny the packet. Otherwise, go to the next test statement.<br><br>Statement Two: access-list 2 permit 192.168.10.0 0.0.0.255<br>Effect: If the source address is from network 192.168.10.0, permit the packet. Otherwise, go to the next test statement.<br><br>Statement Three: access-list 2 deny 192.168.0.0 0.0.255.255<br>Effect: If the source address is from network 192.168.0.0, deny the packet. Otherwise, go to the next test statement.<br><br>Statement Four: access-list 2 permit 192.0.0.0 0.255.255.255<br>Effect: If the source address is from network 192.0.0.0, permit the packet. Otherwise, deny the packet (implicit deny).<br>]]></content-text></brief>
