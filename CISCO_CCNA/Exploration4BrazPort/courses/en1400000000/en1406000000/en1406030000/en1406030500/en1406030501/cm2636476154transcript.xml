<brief><content-text><![CDATA[The diagram depicts tunneling protocols and the VPN packet encapsulation process. <br><br>Tunneling Protocols:<br>Carrier protocol: <br>- The protocol over which the information is traveling (Frame Relay, ATM, MPLS).<br>Encapsulating protocol: <br>- The protocol that is wrapped around the original data (GRE, IPSec, L2F, P P T P, L2TP). <br>Passenger protocol: <br>- The protocol over which the original data was being carried (IPX, AppleTalk, IPv4, IPv6).<br><br>Encapsulation: <br>In the diagram, a sender computer sends a packet to a VPN device. From there, it enters the VPN tunnel in the Internet. It exits the tunnel at a VPN device on the other end. The packet then goes to an access server and then to the receiver.<br><br>The diagram illustrates an SMTP e-mail message traveling through the Internet over a VPN connection. P P P carries the message to the VPN device, where the message is encapsulated within a generic route encapsulation (GRE) packet. The outer packet source and destination addressing is assigned to tunnel interfaces and is made routable across the network. When the composite packet reaches the destination tunnel interface, the inside packet is extracted.<br><br>Packet Encapsulation Protocols (inside to outside):<br><br>Packet from the client computer:<br>SMTP to TCP to IP to P P P<br><br>Packet in transmission through the Internet VPN tunnel:<br>SMTP to TCP to IP to P P P to GRE to IP to IPSec<br><br>Packet from the VPN to the receiving computer:<br>SMTP to TCP to IP to P P P<br>]]></content-text></brief>
