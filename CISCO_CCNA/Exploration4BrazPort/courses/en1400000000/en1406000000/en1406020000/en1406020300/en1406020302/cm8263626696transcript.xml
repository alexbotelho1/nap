<brief><content-text><![CDATA[The diagram depicts information describing DSL connections and photographs of DSL routers and DSL access multiplexer (D SLAM) chassis.<br><br>DSL Connections: <br>A home location labeled SOHO contains a DSL modem, a PC, telephones, and microfilters. The PC connects to the DSL modem and then to the phone line. Each telephone connects to a microfilter, which is between the phone and the phone line. The phone line carries both the DSL data and the telephone voice frequencies back to the telephone company C O. For DSL, the maximum distance between the subscriber and the C O is 5,460 meters or 18,000 feet. At the C O, the voice is split off and sent to the PSTN Class 5 switch. The data is sent to a D SLAM and then to the ISP and Internet.<br><br>DSL Router and D SLAM:<br>Photographs of Cisco 830 and 870 Series broadband routers are shown. Photographs of Cisco 7600 Series Router chassis are also shown.<br>]]></content-text></brief>
