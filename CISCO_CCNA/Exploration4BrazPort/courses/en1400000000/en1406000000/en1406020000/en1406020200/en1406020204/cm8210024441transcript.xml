<brief><content-text><![CDATA[The diagram depicts sending data over cable. The equipment typically used is identified:<br>- Data service runs between cable modem and Cable Modem Termination System (CMTS).<br>- Users on a segment share upstream and downstream bandwidth.<br><br>Network Topology:<br>A building location labeled Headend contains servers (provisioning, cache, Web e-mail) and a CMTS. The CMTS connects to a fiber trunk that connects to a node for distribution to subscribers. The node connects to an amplifier and finally to a drop cable that carries signals to the cable modem in a home.<br><br>Rollover text provides additional information on data-over-cable components:<br><br>CMTS: A cable modem termination system exchanges digital signals with cable modems on a cable network. A headend CMTS communicates with cable modems that are located in subscriber homes.<br><br>Fiber: The trunk portion of the cable network is usually fiber optic cable.<br><br>Node: Nodes convert optical signals to RF signals.<br><br>Cable Modem: A cable modem enables you to receive data at high speeds. Typically, the cable modem attaches to a standard 10 BASE-T Ethernet card in the computer. <br><br>Distribution Area: A distribution network segment (feeder segment) is from 500 to as many as 2000 subscribers.<br>]]></content-text></brief>
