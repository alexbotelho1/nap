<brief><content-text><![CDATA[This is a review and is not a quiz. Questions and answers are provided. <br>Question One. Describe the organizational, social, and environmental benefits of teleworking.<br><br>Answer: <br>Organizational Benefits:<br>- Continuity of operations.<br>- Increased responsiveness.<br>- Secure, reliable, and manageable access to information.<br>- Cost-effective integration of data, voice, video, and applications.<br>- Increased employee productivity, satisfaction, and retention.<br><br>Social Benefits:<br>- Increased employment opportunities for marginalized groups.<br>- Less traveling and commuter-related stress.<br><br>Environmental Benefits:<br>- Reduced carbon footprints, both for individual workers and organizations.<br><br>Question Two. Describe the four main connection methods used by homes and SOHO businesses.<br>Answer:<br>Dialup access: <br>- Dialup access is an inexpensive option that uses any phone line and a modem. <br>- It is the slowest connection option, and is typically used in areas where higher speed connections are not available.<br>DSL: <br>- DSL is more expensive than dialup, but provides a faster connection. <br>- It also uses telephone lines, but unlike dialup access, DSL provides a continuous connection to the Internet. <br>- This connection option uses a special high-speed modem that separates the DSL signal from the telephone signal and provides an Ethernet connection to a host computer or LAN.<br>Cable modem: <br>- A cable modem is a connection option offered by cable television service providers. <br>- The Internet signal is carried on the same coaxial cable that delivers cable television to homes and businesses.<br>- A special cable modem separates the Internet signal from the other signals carried on the cable and provides an Ethernet connection to a host computer or LAN. <br>Satellite: <br>- Satellite connection is an option offered by satellite service providers. <br>- The user's computer connects through Ethernet to a satellite modem that transmits radio signals to the nearest POP within the satellite network.<br><br>Question Three. Describe the two types of VPN's.<br><br>Answer:<br>Site-to-Site VPN's:<br>- A site-to-site VPN is an extension of classic WAN networking and can connect a branch office network to a company headquarters network.<br>- Hosts send and receive TCP/IP traffic through a VPN "gateway" which could be a router, PIX firewall appliance, or an Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA). <br>- The VPN gateway is responsible for encapsulating and encrypting outbound traffic for all of the traffic from a particular site and sending it through a VPN tunnel over the Internet to a peer VPN gateway at the target site.<br>- On receipt, the peer VPN gateway strips the headers, decrypts the content, and relays the packet toward the target host inside its private network.<br>Remote Access VPN's:<br>- Mobile users and telecommuters use remote access VPN's extensively.<br>- Remote VPN connections typically take advantage of the broadband connections.<br>- Each host typically has VPN client software that encapsulates and encrypts that traffic before sending it over the Internet to the VPN gateway at the edge of the target network.<br>- On receipt, the VPN gateway handles the data in the same way as it would handle data from a site-to-site VPN.<br>]]></content-text></brief>
