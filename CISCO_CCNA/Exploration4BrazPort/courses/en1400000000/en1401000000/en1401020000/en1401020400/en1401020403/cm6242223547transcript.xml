<brief><content-text><![CDATA[The diagram depicts an activity in which you fill in the BLANK in the statement with the correct term. Not all answers are used, and some statements have more than one correct answer.<br><br>Statements:<br>- WAN operations occur at the BLANK and BLANK Layers of the O S I model.<br>- A copper or fiber cable connects customer premise equipment, or CPE, to the service provider's nearest BLANK. <br>- The physical BLANK point is the place where the responsibility for the connection changes from the user to the service provider.<br>- A BLANK is a WAN device that converts digital signals to analog format for transmission over an analog line and then converts this analog signal back to digital form so that it can be received and processed by the receiving device on the network. <br>- The BLANK field in WAN frame formats is not needed because WAN links are almost always point-to-point.<br>- A BLANK switching network is one that establishes a dedicated channel between nodes and terminals before the users may communicate.<br>- A BLANK switching network does not require a dedicated channel between nodes. Many pairs of nodes can communicate over the same channel.<br><br>Terms:<br>Physical.<br>Circuit.<br>Protocol.<br>Modem.<br>Central office.<br>Control.<br>Demarcation.<br>Packet.<br>Exchange.<br>Control center.<br>Data link.<br>Address.]]></content-text></brief>
