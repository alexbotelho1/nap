<brief><content-text><![CDATA[The diagram depicts a growing business and its networks in four stages: small office (single LAN), campus (multiple LAN's), branch (WAN), and distributed (global network).<br><br>Small Office (single LAN): A small office with a few employees and devices connected to the Internet using broadband access is shown. A single LAN is used for sharing information, peripherals, and Internet access.<br><br>Campus (multiple LAN's): The network has grown and now consists of several subnetworks and multiple LAN's joined to create a company-wide network, or campus, which spans several floors of the building. All LAN's in the building connect to the Internet using a firewall router. A business campus can consist of hundreds of employees on one or more floors and in neighboring buildings.<br><br>Branch (WAN): The company has opened a branch office, a remote office, and a regional office in addition to the central office. These are interconnected using an Internet WAN composed of multiple Layer 3 switches and a router. <br><br>Distributed (global network): The company has grown to thousands of employees distributed in offices worldwide. Telecommuters, home offices, branch offices, and regional offices all connect to the central office using WAN links, broadband, and the Internet.<br>]]></content-text></brief>
