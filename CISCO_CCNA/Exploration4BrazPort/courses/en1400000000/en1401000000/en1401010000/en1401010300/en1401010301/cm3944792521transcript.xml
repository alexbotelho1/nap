<brief><content-text><![CDATA[The diagram depicts the hierarchical network model and an example topology.<br><br>Hierarchical Network Model:<br>Shown are three nested ovals. The outermost oval is labeled Access. The Access Layer provides local and remote user workgroup access to network devices. <br><br>An oval labeled Distribution is inside the Access oval. The Distribution Layer provides policy-based connectivity.<br><br>The innermost oval is labeled Core. The Core Layer provides a high-speed backbone designed to switch packets as fast as possible. <br><br>Example Topology:<br>The topology consists of Access Layer devices at the bottom of the hierarchy. These include six Layer 2 switches, two of which are connected to WAN routers. One is connected to an Internet router, and another is connected to a telephone switch. The two remaining switches have links to end-user access devices.<br><br>The Distribution Layer is the next level up and consists of three Layer 3 routing switches connected to each other. Each pair of Layer 2 access switches is connected to a Layer 3 distribution switch. The top of the hierarchy is the Core Layer with two Layer 3 routing switches. The three Distribution Layer switches connect to Core Layer switches with redundant links.<br>]]></content-text></brief>
