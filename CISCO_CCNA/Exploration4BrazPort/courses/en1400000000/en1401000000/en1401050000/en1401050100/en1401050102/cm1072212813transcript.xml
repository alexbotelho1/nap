<brief><content-text><![CDATA[This is a review and is not a quiz. Questions and answers are provided. <br>Question One. Describe the three layers of the hierarchical network model.<br>Answer:<br>Access Layer:<br>- Grants user access to network devices.<br>- In a network campus, the Access Layer generally incorporates switched LAN devices with ports that provide connectivity to workstations and servers.<br>- In the WAN environment, it may provide teleworkers or remote sites access to the corporate network across WAN technology.<br>Distribution Layer:<br>- Aggregates the wiring closets, using switches to segment workgroups and isolate network problems in a campus environment.<br>- Similarly, the Distribution Layer aggregates WAN connections at the edge of the campus and provides policy-based connectivity.<br>Core Layer (also referred to as the backbone):<br>- High-speed backbone that is designed to switch packets as fast as possible.<br>- Because the core is critical for connectivity, it must provide a high level of availability and adapt to changes very quickly. It also provides scalability and fast convergence.<br><br>Question Two. <br>Describe the five modules of the Cisco enterprise architecture. <br>Answer:<br>Enterprise Campus Architecture:<br>- An enterprise campus network is a building or group of buildings connected into one network that consists of many  LAN's.<br>- It is generally limited to a fixed geographic area, but it can span several neighboring buildings.<br>- The architecture is modular and scalable and can easily expand to include additional buildings or floors as required.<br>Enterprise Branch Architecture:<br>- This module allows businesses to extend the applications and services found at the enterprise campus to thousands of remote locations and users or to a small group of branches.<br>Enterprise Data Center Architecture:<br>- Data centers are responsible for managing and maintaining the many data systems that are vital to modern business operations.<br>- This module centrally houses the data and resources to enable users to effectively create, collaborate, and interact.<br>Enterprise Teleworker Architecture:<br>- This module leverages the network resources of the enterprise from home using broadband services such as cable modem or DSL to connect to the corporate network.<br>-Typically implemented using remote access VPN's.<br>Enterprise Edge Architecture<br>-This module often functions as a liaison between the campus module and the other modules in the enterprise architecture.<br><br>Question Three. <br>Compare and contrast the following WAN terms: CPE, C O, local loop, DCE, D T E, and demarcation point. <br>Answer:<br>Customer Premises Equipment (CPE):<br>- The devices and inside wiring located at the premises of the subscriber and connected with a telecommunication channel of a carrier.<br>- The subscriber either owns the CPE or leases it from the service provider.<br>Central Office (C O):<br>- A local service provider facility or building where local telephone cables link to long-haul, all-digital, fiber-optic communications lines through a system of switches and other equipment.<br>Local Loop:<br>- Often referred to as the last mile, it is the copper or fiber telephone cable that connects the CPE at the subscriber site to the C O of the service provider.<br>Data Communications Equipment (DCE):<br>- Also called data circuit-terminating equipment, the DCE consists of devices that put data on the local loop.<br>- The DCE primarily provides an interface to connect subscribers to a communication link on the WAN cloud. <br>Data Terminal Equipment (D T E):<br>- The customer devices that pass the data from a customer network or host computer for transmission over the WAN.<br>- The D T E connects to the local loop through the DCE.<br>Demarcation Point:<br>- Physically, it is the cabling junction box located on the customer premises that connects the CPE wiring to the local loop and separates the customer equipment from service provider equipment.<br>- It is the place where the responsibility for the connection changes from the user to the service provider.<br><br>Question Four. <br>Compare and contrast the following WAN devices: modem, CSU/DSU, access server, WAN switch, and router. <br>Answer:<br>Modem:<br>- A voiceband modem converts and reconverts the digital signals produced by a computer into voice frequencies that can be transmitted over the analog lines of the public telephone network.<br>- Faster modems, such as cable and DSL, transmit using higher broadband frequencies.<br>CSU/DSU:<br>- Digital lines, such as T1 or T3 carrier lines, require a channel service unit (CSU) and a data service unit (DSU).<br>- The two are often combined into a single piece of equipment, called the CSU/DSU.<br>- The CSU provides termination for the digital signal and ensures connection integrity through error correction and line monitoring. The DSU converts the T-carrier line frames into frames that the LAN can interpret.<br>Access server:<br>- Concentrates dial-in and dial-out user communications and may have a mixture of analog and digital interfaces. It can support hundreds of simultaneous users.<br>WAN switch:<br>- Multiport internetworking device used in carrier networks to support Frame Relay, ATM, or X.25.<br>Router:<br>Provides internetworking and WAN access interface ports that are used to connect to the service provider network.<br>These interfaces may be serial connections or other WAN interfaces and may require an external device such as a DSU/CSU or modem (analog, cable, or DSL) to connect to the service provider.<br><br>Question Five. <br>Compare and contrast X.25, Frame Relay, and ATM. <br>Answer:<br>X.25 :<br>- Older low-capacity WAN technology with a maximum speed of 48 kilobits per second, typically used in dialup mode with point-of-sale card readers to validate transactions on a central computer.<br>- For these applications, the low bandwidth and high latency are not a concern, and the low cost makes X.25 affordable.<br>- Frame Relay has replaced X.25 at many service provider locations.<br>Frame Relay:<br>- Layer 2 WAN protocol that typically offers data rates of 4 Megabits per second or higher.<br>- It provides permanent, shared, medium-bandwidth connectivity using virtual circuits capable of carrying both voice and data traffic.<br>- VC's are uniquely identified by a DLCI, which ensures bidirectional communication from one D T E device to another.<br>ATM:<br>- Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) technology is based on a cell-based architecture rather than a frame-based architecture, using fixed length cells of 53 bytes.<br>- These small, fixed-length cells are well suited for carrying delay-sensitive voice and video traffic.<br>]]></content-text></brief>
