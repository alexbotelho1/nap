<brief><content-text><![CDATA[The diagram depicts a table with characteristics of various WAN technology options for use in choosing a WAN link connection.<br><br>Option: Leased line.<br>Description: Point-to-point connection between two computers or LAN's.<br>Advantages: Most secure.<br>Disadvantages: Expensive.<br>Sample protocols used: P P P, HDLC, SDLC, HNAS.<br><br>Option: Circuit switching.<br>Description: A dedicated circuit path is created between endpoints. Best example is a dialup connection.<br>Advantages: Less expensive.<br>Disadvantages: Call setup.<br>Sample protocols used: P P P, ISDN.<br><br>Option: Packet switching.<br>Description: Devices transport packets via a shared single point-to-point or point-to-multipoint link across a carrier interwork. Variable length packets are transmitted over PVC's or SVC's.<br>Advantages: None listed.<br>Disadvantages: Shared media across link.<br>Sample protocols used: X.25, Frame Relay.<br><br>Option: Cell relay.<br>Description: Similar to packet switching, but uses fixed-length cells instead of variable-length packets. Data is divided into fixed-length cells and then transported across virtual circuits.<br>Advantages: Best for simulated use of voice and data.<br>Disadvantages: Overhead can be considerable.<br>Sample protocols used: ATM.<br><br>Option: Internet.<br>Description: Connectionless packet switching using the Internet as the WAN infrastructure. Uses network addressing to deliver packets. Because of security issues, VPN technology must be used.<br>Advantages: Least expensive and globally available.<br>Disadvantages: Least secure.<br>Sample protocols used: VPN, DSL, cable modem, wireless.<br>]]></content-text></brief>
