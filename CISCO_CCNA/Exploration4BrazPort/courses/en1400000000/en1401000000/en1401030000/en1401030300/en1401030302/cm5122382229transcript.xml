ISDN basic rate interface, BR I, and primary rate interface, PRI, are shown.<br><br>ISDN Dialup WAN Topology:<br>Two buildings are connected using ISDN through a public ISDN WAN link.<br><br>A PC and a server in one office connect to a router that is connected to an ISDN terminal adapter, T A. The T A connects to a telephone line and then to an ISDN switch in the PSTN cloud. Three PC's in another office connect to a router, which connects to a telephone line and then to an ISDN switch in the PSTN cloud.<br><br>In the diagram, the ISDN BR I is two 64 kilobits per second B channels and one 16 kilobits per second D channel. The ISDN PRI is 23 64 kilobits per second B channels, T1, or 30 64 kilobits per second B channels, E1, and one 64 kilobits per second D channel. The T1 provides 1.544 megabits per second, and the E1 provides 2.048 megabits per second, which includes sync.<br>]]></content-text></brief>
