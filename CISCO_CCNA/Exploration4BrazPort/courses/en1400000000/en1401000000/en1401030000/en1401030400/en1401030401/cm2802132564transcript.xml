<brief><content-text><![CDATA[The diagram depicts common packet-switching WAN technologies, including Frame Relay, ATM, and legacy X.25.<br><br>X.25 Network Topology:<br>Three buildings are shown, Branch Office A, Branch Office B, and the corporate head office. They are interconnected by three X.25 switches in a cloud using switched virtual circuits (SVC's) and permanent virtual circuits (PVC's). A router in each office connects to a CSU/DSU, which connects to one of the X.25 switches in the cloud.<br><br>Frame Relay Network Topology:<br>Two buildings are shown, a branch office and corporate head office. They are interconnected by an ISP router in a cloud using Frame Relay. A router (D T E) in each office connects to the ISP router, which acts as a Frame Relay switch and provides the DCE for each connection. This creates a Frame Relay virtual circuit that is identified at the branch office by data-link connection identifier DLCI 201 and at the corporate head office by DLCI 102.<br><br>ATM Network Topology:<br>Two buildings are shown, a branch office and corporate head office. They are interconnected by a service provider ATM network cloud. At the corporate head office, e-mail, a V o IP phone, a Web server, and an IP TV broadcast are all funneled through a router to an ATM switch at the edge of the cloud. The different transmission packets are broken into ATM cells and are interleaved as they traverse the service provider ATM network to another ATM switch to reach the branch office LAN.<br>]]></content-text></brief>
