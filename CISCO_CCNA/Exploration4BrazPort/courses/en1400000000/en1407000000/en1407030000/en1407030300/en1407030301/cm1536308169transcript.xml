<brief><content-text><![CDATA[The diagram depicts IPv6 transition strategies.<br><br>Network Topology:<br>Two IPv6 network clouds are interconnected by an IPv4 network cloud, such as the Internet.<br><br>IPv6 Host1 is connected to IPv6 Network Cloud1, which is connected to R1, a 6-to-4 router. R1 is connected to the IPv4 network cloud. IPv6 Host2 is connected to IPv6 Network Cloud2, which is connected to R2, a 6-to-4 router. R2 is also connected to the IPv4 network cloud. The two 6-to-4 routers allow IPv6 traffic to travel between them over the IPv4 network.<br><br>Different transition mechanisms:<br>-	Dual stack<br>-	Manual tunnel<br>-	6-to-4 tunnel<br>-	ISATAP tunnel<br>-	Teredo tunnel<br><br>Different compatibility mechanisms:<br>-	Proxying and translation (NAT-PT)The diagram depicts IPv6 transition strategies.<br><br>Network Topology:<br>Two IPv6 network clouds are interconnected by an IPv4 network cloud, such as the Internet.<br><br>IPv6 Host1 is connected to IPv6 Network Cloud1, which is connected to R1, a 6-to-4 router.
