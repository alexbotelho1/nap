<brief><content-text><![CDATA[The diagram depicts an IPv6 address configuration example. A router is shown connected to an IPv6 LAN with the a subnet prefix address of 2001:db8:c18:1::/64. The following commands are issued on the router to activate IPv6 routing and configure the router Ethernet 0 interface. The EUI-64 option is used to create the 64-bit MAC address.<br><br>RouterX(config)#i pv6 unicast-routing<br>RouterX(config)#interface Ethernet 0<br>RouterX(config-i f)#i pv6 address 2001:db8:c18:1::/64 e u i-64<br><br>The MAC address of the interface is 0260.3e47.1530. In the output from the show i pv6 interface Ethernet 0 command, the MAC address is displayed as part of the IPv6 address with the hex characters FFFE (16 bits) imbedded in the middle, which expands the 48-bit MAC address to create the IPv6 64-bit link local address.<br><br>RouterX#show i pv6 interface Ethernet 0<br>Ethernet0 is up, line protocol is up<br>  IPv6 is enabled, link-local address is FE80::260:3EFF:FE47:1530<br>Global unicast addresses:<br>  2001:DB8:C18:1:260:3EFF:FE47:1530, subnet is 2001:DB8:C18:1::/64<br>Joined group addresses:<br>  FF02::1:FF47:1530<br>  FF02::1<br>  FF02::2<br>MTU is 1500 bytes]]></content-text></brief>
