<brief><content-text><![CDATA[The diagram depicts an activity where you implement IPv6. <br><br>Note: You may want to contact your instructor for assistance with this activity.<br><br>A network is being transitioned from IPv4 to IPv6. Your task is to complete the IPv6 configuration on all routers using the following information. Enter the commands necessary to complete the following on each router:<br>- Enable IPv6 traffic forwarding.<br>- Configure and enable specified interfaces with the IPv6 addresses.<br>- Configure IPv6 RIP using the process name cisco.<br>- Enable the IPv6 routing process named cisco on the required interfaces.<br><br>Network Topology <br>There are three routers. Router R1 S0/0/0 is connected to R2 S0/0/0. Router R2 S0/0/1 is connected to R3 S0/0/1.<br><br>Router configuration information:<br>Hostname: R1<br>Interface s0/0/0: 2001:410:1:10::/65 e u i-64<br>Interface s0/0/1: not connected<br><br>What configuration commands should be used for R1?<br><br><br>Hostname: R2<br>Interface s0/0/0: 2001:410:1:10::/65 e u i-64<br>Interface s0/0/1: 2001:410:2:10::/65 e u i-64<br><br>What configuration commands should be used for R1?<br><br><br>Hostname: R3<br>Interface s0/0/0: not connected<br>Interface s0/0/1: 2001:410:2:10::/65 e u i-64<br><br>What configuration commands should be used for R1?]]></content-text></brief>
