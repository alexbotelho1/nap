<brief><content-text><![CDATA[The diagram depicts the IPv6 address structure including formats, representation, and examples. <br><br>IPv6 Format:<br>-	x:x:x:x:x:x:x:x, where x is a 16-bit hexadecimal field.<br>-	Case-insensitive for hexadecimal A, B, C, D, E, and F. <br>-	Leading zeros in a field are optional. <br>-	Successive fields of zeros can be represented as :: only once per address. <br><br>Examples:<br>-	2031:0000:130F:0000:0000:09C0:876A:130B<br>- Can be represented as 2031:0:130f::9c0:876a:130b<br>- Cannot be represented as 2031::130f::9c0:876a:130b<br>-	FF01:0:0:0:0:0:0:1		FF01::1<br>-	0:0:0:0:0:0:0:1		::1<br>-	0:0:0:0:0:0:0:0		::<br><br><br>Representation:<br>-	2031:0000:130F:0000:0000:09C0:876A:130B<br>- Can be represented as 2031:0:130f::9c0:876a:130b<br>- Cannot be represented as 2031::130f::9c0:876a:130b<br><br>The diagram is based on the previous example and shows:<br>-	The second 16-bit hex field of 0000 can be abbreviated as 0.<br>-	The fourth and fifth 16-bit hex fields of 0000:0000 can be abbreviated as 0:0 or compressed to simply ::.<br>-	The sixth 16-bit hex field of 09C0 can be abbreviated as 9C0 by dropping the leading zero.<br><br>Examples:<br>-	FF01:0:0:0:0:0:0:1 becomes FF01::1<br>-	0:0:0:0:0:0:0:1 becomes ::1<br>-	0:0:0:0:0:0:0:0 becomes ::<br>-	FF01:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:1 becomes FF01:0:0:0:0:0:0:1 becomes FF01::1<br>-	E3D7:0000:0000:0000:51F4:00C8:C0A8:6420 becomes E3D7::51F4:C8:C0A8:6420<br>-	3FFE:0501:0008:0000:0260:97FF:FE40:EFAB becomes 3FFE:501:8:0:260:97FF:FE40:EFAB becomes 3FFE:501:8::260:97FF:FE40:EFAB<br>]]></content-text></brief>
