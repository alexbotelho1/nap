<brief><content-text><![CDATA[The diagram depicts the depletion of IPv4 address space and why we need more address space. <br><br>Blocks:<br>A matrix is shown with blocks of IP addresses identified as allocated, unavailable, and available, starting with year 1993. As the animation progresses through years 2000 and 2007, the number of allocated blocks increases significantly to where there are very few blocks available.<br><br>Shrinking:<br>A bar chart view of the information in the previous matrix shows the allocated, unavailable, and available blocks of IP addresses for the years 1993, 2000, and 2007. The number of allocated blocks increases significantly while the available blocks decrease significantly. Unavailable blocks stays consistent.<br><br>Why IPv6:<br>A global collage of IP devices, labeled Global Addressing Realm, is shown with the question "Why do we need a larger address space?"<br><br>Only compelling reason: more IP addresses!<br>- For billions of new users and new consumer devices in Asia, Europe, and America and mobile phones, cars, PDA's, and home and industrial appliances<br>- For always-on access (cable, xDSL, wireless, Ethernet-to-the-home)<br>- For applications that are difficult, expensive, or impossible to operate through NAT (IP telephony, IP fax, peer-to-peer gaming, home servers)<br>]]></content-text></brief>
