<brief><content-text><![CDATA[The diagram depicts using the Cisco I O S dual-stack transition mechanism.<br><br>Dual Stack:<br>Network Topology:<br>An IPv6 network cloud and an IPv4 network cloud are connected to a router running Cisco I O S dual stack with IPv4 and IPv6. IPv6 Host1 and IPv4 Host2 are on the same network segment and are also connected to router R1. A protocol stack is expanded from R1 as follows:<br><br>Layer 5 - Application (upper layers)<br>Layer 4 - TCP/UDP<br>Layer 3 - IPv4 and IPv6<br>Layer 2 - Driver <br>Layer 1 - Physical (not shown)<br><br>Dual stack is an integration method in which a node has implementation and connectivity to both an IPv4 and IPv6 network.<br><br>Configuring an IPv6 Interface:<br>The diagram shows an IPv4 and IPv6 network connected to router A on its Ethernet 0 interface. Router A interface Ethernet 0 has the IPv4 address 192.168.99.1/24 and IPv6 address 3ffe:b00:800:1::3/127. When both IPv4 and IPv6 are configured on an interface, the interface is considered dual-stacked.<br><br>Configuration Commands:<br>RouterA#conf t<br>RouterA(config)#i pv6 unicast-routing<br>RouterA(config)#interface ethernet0<br>RouterA(config-i f)#i p address 192.168.99.1 255.255.255.0<br>RouterA(config-i f)#i pv6 address 3ffe:b00:800:1::3/127<br>]]></content-text></brief>
