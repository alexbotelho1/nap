<brief><content-text><![CDATA[The diagram depicts IPv6 tunneling as a transition mechanism.<br><br>Network Topology:<br>Two IPv6 network clouds are interconnected by an IPv4 network cloud, such as the Internet. IPv6 Host1 is connected to IPv6 Network Cloud1, which is connected to R1, a dual-stacked router. R1 is connected to the IPv4 network cloud. IPv6 Host2 is connected to IPv6 Network Cloud2, which is connected to R2, a dual-stacked router. R2 is also connected to the IPv4 network cloud.<br><br>Tunneling is an integration method in which an IPv6 packet is encapsulated within another protocol, such as IPv4. This method of encapsulation is IPv4:<br>-	Includes a 20-byte IPv4 header with no options, and an IPv6 header and payload. <br>-	Requires dual-stack routers.<br><br>The two dual-stacked routers, R1 and R2, provide a tunnel for IPv6 over IPv4 packets. The IPv6 data is encapsulated in an IPv6 header, and the entire IPv6 data and IPv6 header combined are encapsulated in an IPv4 header.<br>]]></content-text></brief>
