<brief><content-text><![CDATA[The diagram depicts a manually configured IPv6 tunnel.<br><br>Network Topology:<br>Two IPv6 network clouds are interconnected by an IPv4 network cloud, such as the Internet.<br><br>IPv6 Network Cloud1 is connected to R1, a dual-stacked router. R1 is connected to the IPv4 network cloud. IPv6 Network Cloud2 is connected to R2, a dual-stacked router. R2 is also connected to the IPv4 network cloud.<br><br>Configured tunnels require:<br>-	Dual-stack endpoints.<br>-	IPv4 and IPv6 addresses configured at each end.<br><br>Router R1's tunnel interface has IPv4 address 192.168.99.1 and IPv6 address 3ffe:b00:c18:1::3. Router R2's tunnel interface has IPv4 address 192.168.30.1 and IPv6 address 3ffe:b00:c18:2::2.<br>]]></content-text></brief>
