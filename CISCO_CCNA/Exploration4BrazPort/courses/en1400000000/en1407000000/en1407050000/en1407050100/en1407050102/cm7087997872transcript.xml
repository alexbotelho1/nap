<brief><content-text><![CDATA[This is a review and is not a quiz. Questions and answers are provided. <br>Question One. Describe the four DHCP discovery and offer messages in sequence of operation and function.<br>Answer: <br>DHCP DISCOVER message:<br>-	Broadcast forwarded by the host looking for a DHCP server.<br>-	Messages are forwarded to the DHCP BOOT P server using UDP port 67.<br>DHCP OFFER message:<br>-	When the DHCP DISCOVER message reaches the DHCP server, the server responds with a unicast DHCP OFFER message containing the MAC address of the client, offered IP address and mask, default gateway, and the IP address of the server.<br>-	Messages are forwarded to the DHCP BOOT P client using UDP port 68.<br>DHCP REQUEST message:<br>-	Used for two purposes: first, to initially negotiate an IP address lease, and second, to renegotiate (or renew) the IP address halfway through its lease time.<br>-	The client broadcasts the DHCP REQUEST message to the DHCP server using UDP port 67.<br>DHCP ACK message:<br>-	Nearly identical to the original DHCP OFFER but sent to the client to confirm that it now can use that address using UDP port 68.<br><br>Question Two. Refer to the topology diagram description below to answer the question.<br><br>Network Topology:<br>Two LAN's, with network addresses 192.168.10.0/24 and 192.168.11.0/24, are connected by router R1. PC1 in LAN 1 is connected to switch S1, which is connected to R1 interface FA0/0. PC2 in LAN 2 is connected to switch S2, which is connected to R1 interface FA0/1.<br><br>PC1 IP address: 192.168.10.10/24<br>Switch S1 IP address: 192.168.10.2/24<br>Router R1 FA0/0 IP address: 192.168.10.1/24<br><br>PC2 IP address: No IP address obtained<br>Switch S2 IP address: 192.168.11.2/24<br>Router R1 FA0/1 IP address: 192.168.11.1/24<br><br>Question:<br>Router R1 has been configured to provide DHCP service to the hosts on network 192.168.11.0/24, excluding the first nine IP addresses from the pool. However, after releasing and renewing its IP address, host PC2 still cannot acquire an IP address automatically. Which changes in the configuration would help this problem?<br><br>Commands used to configure R1:<br>hostname R1<br>i p dhcp excluded-address 192.168.11.1 192.168.11.254<br>i p dhcp pool LAN-POOL-2<br>network 192.168.10.0 255.255.255.0<br>default-router 192.168.11.2<br>domain-name span.com<br>	<br>Answer: On router R1<br>- The pool is excluding the entire pool. The command should be i p dhcp excluded-address 192.168.11.1 192.168.11.9.<br>- The network pool is allocating the wrong subnet. The command should be network 192.168.11.0 255.255.255.0.<br>- The default router IP address is pointing to the switch. The command should be default-router 192.168.11.1.<br><br>Question Three.<br>Refer to the topology diagram description below to answer the question.<br><br>Network Topology:<br>Two LAN's, with network addresses 192.168.10.0/24 and 192.168.11.0/24, are connected by router R1. PC1 in LAN 1 is connected to switch S1, which is connected to R1 interface FA0/0. PC2 in LAN 2 is connected to switch S2, which is connected to R1 interface FA0/1.<br><br>PC1 IP address: 192.168.10.10/24<br>Switch S1 IP address: 192.168.10.2/24<br>Router R1 FA0/0 IP address: 192.168.10.1/24<br><br>PC2 IP address: 192.168.11.10/24<br>Switch S2 IP address: 192.168.11.2/24<br>Router R1 FA0/1 IP address: 192.168.11.1/24<br>DHCP Server IP address: 192.168.11.5/24<br><br>Question:<br>The DHCP server located at IP address 192.168.11.5 has been configured to provide IP addresses to the hosts on network 192.168.10.1/24. However, the hosts receive an error stating that their DHCP server request has timed out and that the DHCP server is unreachable. Which configuration command would correct this problem?<br><br>Answer: On router R1, configure the DHCP relay feature on interface Fast Ethernet 0/0 using the following commands:<br><br>interface FastEthernet0/0<br>i p helper-address 192.168.11.5<br><br>Question Four. Describe the differences between dynamic NAT, static NAT, and NAT overload.<br>Answer: <br>Dynamic NAT:<br>-	Dynamic NAT uses a pool of public addresses and assigns them on a first-come, first-served basis. <br>-	When a host requests access to the Internet, dynamic NAT chooses an IP address from the public pool and temporarily binds it with the internal local address.<br>Static NAT:<br>-	Static NAT uses a one-to-one mapping of local and global addresses and these mappings remain constant. <br>-	Static NAT is particularly useful for web servers or in general hosts that must have a consistent address that is accessible from the Internet.<br>NAT Overload:<br>-	NAT overloading (sometimes called Port Address Translation or PAT) maps inside local IP addresses to a combination of a global IP address and unique port number. <br>-	When a response returns to the NAT router, the router examines the source port number and forwards the packet to the originating inside local address. <br>-	It also validates that the incoming packets were requested, thus adding a degree of security to the session.<br><br>Question Five.<br>Router R2 has been configured to provide NAT service. On the basis of the information provided, comment on the NAT translations.<br><br>Refer to the command output to answer the question.<br>R2#show i p nat translations<br>Pro: tcp<br>Inside Global: 209.165.200.225:16642<br>Inside Local: 192.168.10.10:16642<br>Outside Local IP Address: 209.165.200.254:80<br>Outside Global: 209.165.200.254:80<br><br>Pro: tcp<br>Inside Global: 209.165.200.225:62452<br>Inside Local: 192.168.10.10:62452<br>Outside Local IP Address: 209.165.200.254:80<br>Outside Global: 209.165.200.254:80<br><br><br>Answer: Router R2 was configured to provide NAT overload translation to hosts on the 192.168.10.0 and 192.168.11.0 networks.<br><br>- The host with the inside local IP address 192.168.10.10 was translated to the overloaded inside global IP address 209.165.200.225 using the unique port number 16642 when accessing the web server located at 209.165.200.254.<br>- The host with the inside local IP address 192.168.11.10 was translated to the overloaded inside global IP address 209.165.200.255 using the unique port number 62452 when accessing the web server located at 209.165.200.254.<br><br>Question Six. Refer to the following IPv6 host address. Abbreviate the IPv6 address to its shortest allowable form.<br>Address: 2031:0000:130F:0000:0000:09C0:876A:130B<br><br>Answer: The shortest form is 2031:0:130F::9C0:876A:130B<br><br>Question Seven. Refer to following statement and fill in the blanks. Describe the two main IPv4-to-IPv6 transition options and complete the IPv6 transition sentence in the exhibit.<br><br>Statement:<br>"BLANK" where you can, "BLANK" where you must!"<br><br>Answer:<br>"Dual-stack where you can, tunnel where you must!"<br><br>Dual-stack method:<br>-	Is an integration method in which a node has implementation and connectivity to both an IPv4 and IPv6 network.<br>-	This is the recommended option and involves running IPv4 and IPv6 at the same time.<br>-	Router and switches are configured to support both protocols, with IPv6 being the preferred protocol.<br><br>6-to-4 tunneling method:<br>-	Is an integration method in which an IPv6 packet is encapsulated within the IPv4 protocol.<br>-	However, this method also requires dual-stack routers.<br>-	The dynamic 6-to-4 tunneling method automatically establishes the connection of IPv6 islands through an IPv4 network.<br>Other tunneling methods:<br>-	Other tunneling protocols include NAT-PT, ISATAP tunneling, and Teredo tunneling.<br>-	These tunneling protocols are complex and are considered methods of last resort.<br>]]></content-text></brief>
