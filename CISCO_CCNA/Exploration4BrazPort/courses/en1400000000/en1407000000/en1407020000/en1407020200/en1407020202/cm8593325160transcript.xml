<brief><content-text><![CDATA[The animation depicts how NAT works.<br><br>The diagram shows PC1 connected to router R1, which is connected to router R2. R2 is connected to the ISP router in a cloud. A Web server is connected to the ISP cloud. <br><br>PC1 IP address: 192.168.10.10<br>ISP Web Server: 209.165.201.1<br><br>A NAT table contains the following entries. <br>Inside Local Address: 192.168.10.10<br>Inside Global Address: 209.165.200.226<br>Outside Global Address: 209.165.201.1<br><br>As the animation progresses:<br>Step 1. PC1 sends a packet to router R1 with source address 192.168.10.10.<br>Step 2. The packet is forwarded by R1 to R2, which translates the inside local IP address (192.168.10.10) to an inside global IP address (209.165.200.226). The source address of the packet is now 209.165.200.226, and it is passed through the ISP router and on to the Web server.<br>Step 3. The web server sends return packets to destination address 209.165.200.226, and the packet travels back to router R2.<br>Step 4. R2 translates the inside global IP address 209.165.200.226 to the inside local IP address 192.168.10.10 and forwards it to R1, which delivers it to PC1.<br>]]></content-text></brief>
