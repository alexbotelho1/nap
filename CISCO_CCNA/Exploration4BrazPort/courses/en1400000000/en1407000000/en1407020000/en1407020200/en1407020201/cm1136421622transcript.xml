<brief><content-text><![CDATA[The diagram depicts using NAT to translate private addresses to public addresses and identifies related NAT terminology.<br><br>Network Topology:<br>Three LAN's, 192.168.10.0/24, 192.168.11.0/24, and 192.168.30.0/24, are connected by three routers, R1, R2, and R3 in a corporate stub network with only one exit to the outside. The corporate stub network devices use only private address space internally. Router R2 is a NAT-enabled border router that connects to the ISP.<br><br>PC1 in LAN 1 is connected to switch S1, which is connected to R1 interface FA0/0.<br>PC2 in LAN 2 is connected to switch S2, which is connected to R1 interface FA0/1. <br>PC3 in LAN 3 is connected to switch S3, which is connected to R3 interface FA0/1.<br><br>Router R1 interface S0/0/0 is connected to R2 interface S0/0/0.<br>Router R3 interface S0/0/1 is connected to R2 interface S0/0/1.<br>Router R2 interface S0/1/0 is connected to the ISP.<br><br>PC1 IP address: 192.168.10.10/24<br>PC2 IP address: 192.168.11.10/24<br>PC3 IP address: 192.168.30.10/24<br><br>Switch S1 IP address: 192.168.10.2/24<br>Switch S2 IP address: 192.168.11.2/24<br>Switch S3 IP address: 192.168.30.2/24<br><br>Router R1 FA0/0 IP address: 192.168.10.1/24<br>Router R1 FA0/1 IP address: 192.168.11.1/24<br>Router R1 S0/0/0 IP address: 10.1.1.1/30<br><br>Router R2 S0/0/0 IP address: 10.1.1.2/30<br>Router R2 S0/0/1 IP address: 10.2.2.1/30<br>Router R2 S0/1/0 IP address: 209.165.200.225/27<br><br>Router R3 FA0/1 IP address: 192.168.30.1/24<br>Router R3 S0/0/1 IP address: 10.2.2.2/30<br><br>NAT Terminology:<br>The diagram shows PC1 connected to an inside network cloud, which is connected to router R2. R2 is connected to the ISP router in a cloud. A Web server is connected to the ISP cloud. A bubble from R2 says: "NAT-enabled router. NAT Pool 209.165.200.226 to 230."<br><br>PC1 IP address: 192.168.10.10<br>Router R2 S0/1/0 NAT Pool IP address: 209.165.200.226 to 230<br>ISP Web Server IP address: 209.165.201.1<br><br>A NAT table contains the following entries. <br>Inside Local Address: 192.168.10.10 (Arrow points to PC1)<br>Inside Global Address: 209.165.200.226 (Arrow points to packet with source address (S A) at the R2 external interface)<br>Outside Global Address: 209.165.201.1 (Arrow points to ISP Web Server)<br>]]></content-text></brief>
