<brief><content-text><![CDATA[The diagram depicts DHCP discovery and offer methods. PC Client A, without an IP address, is shown connected to a DHCP server, with IP address 192.168.1.254/24. An Ethernet frame, IP packet, and UDP segment are shown encapsulating a DHCP DISCOVER message. <br><br>DHCP Discover:<br>The DHCP client sends a local IP broadcast with a DHCP discover packet. In the simplest case, a DHCP server on the same segment will pick up this request. The server notes that the gateway IP address (GIADDR) field is blank, so the client is on the same segment. The server also notes the hardware address of the client in the request packet.<br><br>Ethernet frame:<br>SOURCE MAC: MAC A<br>DESTINATION MAC: FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF<br><br>IP packet:<br>IP SOURCE: 0.0.0.0<br>IP DESTINATION: 255.255.255.255<br><br>UDP segment: <br>UDP 67<br><br>DHCP DISCOVER message:<br>CIient IP Address: ?<br>Mask: ?<br>Gateway IP Address: ?<br>Client Hardware Address: MAC A<br><br>Legend for DHCP DISCOVER message:<br>MAC: Media Access Control Address<br>CIADDR: Client IP Address<br>GIADDR: Gateway IP Address<br>CHADDR: Client Hardware Address<br><br>DHCP Offer:<br>The DHCP server sends a DHCP OFFER message as a unicast. The DHCP server picks an IP address from the available pool for that segment, as well as the other segment and global parameters. It puts them into the appropriate fields of the DHCP packet. It then uses the hardware address of Client A to construct an appropriate frame to send back to the client.<br><br>Ethernet frame:<br>SOURCE MAC: MAC Server<br>DESTINATION MAC: MAC Client A<br><br>IP packet:<br>IP SOURCE: 192.168.1.254<br>IP DESTINATION: 192.168.1.10<br><br>UDP segment: <br>UDP 68<br><br>DHCP OFFER message:<br>CIient IP Address: 192.168.1.10<br>Mask: 255.255.255.0<br>Gateway IP Address: ?<br>CIient Hardware Address: MAC A<br><br>Legend for DHCP OFFER message:<br>MAC: Media Access Control Address<br>CIADDR: Client IP Address<br>GIADDR: Gateway IP Address <br>CHADDR: Client Hardware Address]]></content-text></brief>
