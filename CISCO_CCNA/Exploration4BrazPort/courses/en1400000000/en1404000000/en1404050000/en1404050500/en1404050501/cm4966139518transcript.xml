<brief><content-text><![CDATA[The diagram depicts the loss of the Cisco I O S image and the use of tftpdnld and a three-step process to restore the Cisco I O S software images.<br><br>Network Topology:<br>PC1 and a system administrator laptop are connected to switch S1, which is connected to router R1. Router R1 is connected to router R2 via WAN links. A TFTP server with IP address 192.168.20.254 is connected to R2. Router R1 loses its Cisco I O S image.<br><br>Step 1. Connect the devices. Connect the PC of the system administrator to the console port on the affected router. Connect the TFTP server to the first Ethernet port on the router. In this case, R1 interface FA0/0. Enable the TFTP server and configure it with a static IP address 192.168.1.1 /24. <br><br>Step 2. Boot the router and set the ROM mon variables.<br>Rom mon1> IP_ADDRESS=192.168.1.2<br>Rom mon2> IP_SUBNET_MASK=255.255.255.0<br>Rom mon3> DEFAULT_GATEWAY=192.168.1.1<br>Rom mon4> TFTP_SERVER=192.168.1.1<br>Rom mon5> TFTP_FILE=c1841-ipbase-mz. 123-14.T7.bin<br><br>Step 3. Enter the tftpdnld command at the ROM mon prompt. The command displays the required environment variables and warns that all existing data in flash will be erased.
