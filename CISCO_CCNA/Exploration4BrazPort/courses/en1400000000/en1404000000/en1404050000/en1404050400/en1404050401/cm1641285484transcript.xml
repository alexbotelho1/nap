<brief><content-text><![CDATA[The diagram depicts a three-step process to save an Cisco I O S software image.<br><br>Network Topology:<br>PC1 and a system administrator laptop are connected to switch S1, which is connected to router R1. Router R1 is connected to router R2 via WAN links. A TFTP server with IP address 192.168.20.254 is connected to R2. <br><br>The process of saving the Cisco I O S software image of R1 on the TFTP server is described in three steps.<br><br>Step 1. Ping the TFTP server to make sure that you have access to it. The output shows successful ping results.<br><br>Step 2. Use the show flash colon command on the router to determine the size of the Cisco I O S image file and verify that the TFTP server has sufficient disk space to accommodate the file. The output shows the Cisco I O S image filename and its size in bytes.<br><br>Step 3. Use the copy flash colon tftp colon command to copy the current system image file from the router to the network TFTP server. The output shows prompts for the source filename, address of remote host, and destination filename. Exclamation points and a message indicting the number of bytes copied verify a successful file transfer.<br>]]></content-text></brief>
