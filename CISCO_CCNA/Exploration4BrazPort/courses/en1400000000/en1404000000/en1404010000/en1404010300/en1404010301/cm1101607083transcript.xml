<brief><content-text><![CDATA[The diagram depicts types of network attacks. Icons represent four types of attacks: reconnaissance, access, denial of service (D o S), and worms, viruses, and trojan horses. <br><br>The diagram also shows an attacker and computer on the same local network as two PC's and two servers. Clicking each attack type starts an animation of how the attack works.<br><br>Reconnaissance:<br>The attacker computer retrieves address information from the four hosts and starts the N MAP application to probe for vulnerabilities.<br><br>Access:<br>The attacker computer accesses one of the four compromised hosts and gains root level access via FTP. <br><br>Denial of Service (D o S):<br>The attacker computer pings one of the servers with the command ping 10.10.10.2 -l 5000, which sends echo requests of 5,000 bytes to the server in an attempt to occupy its resources and prevent other legitimate users from accessing it. <br><br>Worms, Viruses, and Trojan Horses:<br>The attacker computer sends an email with a worm attached to the four hosts, so the users will open it and compromise their computers. <br>]]></content-text></brief>
