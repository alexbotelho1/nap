<brief><content-text><![CDATA[The diagram depicts icons representing four types of reconnaissance attacks: Internet information queries, ping sweeps, port scans, and packet sniffers.<br><br>The diagram also shows an attacker and computer on the same local network as two PC's and two servers. Clicking each attack type starts an animation of how the attack works.<br><br>Internet information queries:<br>The attacker issues a Who is dot Net request from a computer to obtain host domain name information.<br><br>Ping sweeps:<br>The attacker computer retrieves address information from the four hosts and starts the N MAP application to probe for vulnerabilities.<br><br>Port scans:<br>The attacker computer retrieves application and open port status information from the four hosts using the N MAP application.<br><br>Packet sniffers:<br>The attacker computer monitors traffic to and from the four hosts using the Wireshark application.<br>]]></content-text></brief>
