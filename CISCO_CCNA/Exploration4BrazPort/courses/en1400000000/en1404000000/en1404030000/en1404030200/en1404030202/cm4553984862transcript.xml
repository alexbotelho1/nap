<brief><content-text><![CDATA[The diagram depicts configuring RIP v2 with routing protocol authentication using three steps. The network topology is the same as the one for the attack animation, except that the R1 S0/0/0 interface has an IP address of 10.1.1.1/30, and the R2 S0/0/0 interface has an IP address of 10.1.1.2/30. LAN 192.168.20.1 /24 is also attached to R2.<br><br>Step One - Prevent RIP routing update propagation. A text bubble is pointing to routers R1 and R3 stating: Prevent RIP routing update propagation to those without entitlement. <br><br>R1 configuration commands:<br>R1(config)#router rip<br>R1(config-router)#passive-interface default<br>R1(config-router)#no passive-interface s0/0/0<br><br>Step Two - Prevent unauthorized reception of RIP updates. A text bubble is pointing to routers R1, R2, and R3 stating: Configure RIP authentication.<br><br>R1 configuration commands:<br>R1(config)#key chain RIP_KEY<br>R1(config-keychain)#key 1<br>R1(config-keychain-key)#key-string cisco<br><br>R1(config)#int s0/0/0<br>R1(config-i f)# i p rip authentication mode md5 <br>R1(config-i f)# i p rip authentication key-chain RIP_KEY<br><br>Step Three - Verify RIP routing. A text bubble is pointing to router R1 stating: Verify RIP routing.<br><br>R1 verification commands:<br>R1#show i p route<br>Codes: C - connected,S - static,R - RIP,<br>Output omitted.<br><br>R192.168.30.0 /24 [120 /2] via 10.1.1.2, 00:00:16, Serial 0/0/0<br>C192.168.10.0 /24 is directly connected, FastEthernet 0/0<br>R192.168.20.0 /24 [120 /1] via 10.1.1.2, 00:00:13, Serial 0/0/0<br>10.0.0.0 /8 is variably subnetted, 2 subnets, 1 masks<br>Output omitted.]]></content-text></brief>
