<brief><content-text><![CDATA[The diagram depicts an overview of routing protocol authentication. Information is provided on attacks, protecting updates, and operation.<br><br>Attack:<br>Network Topology:<br>PC1 is connected to switch S1, which is connected to router R1. Router R1 is connected to router R2 with a WAN link. Router R2 is connected to a cloud and then to R3, which is connected to switch S3 and finally PC3. <br><br>PC1 IP Address: 192.168.10.10/24<br>PC3 IP Address: 192.168.30.10/24<br><br>Attack:<br>As the animation progresses:<br>A.	An attacker sends an update that says: Tell R1 that 192.168.10.10/32 is reachable through R3. As a result, R1 updates its routing table. <br>B.	PC3 sends a packet to R3 destined for PC1 at 192.168.10.10.<br>C.	R1 receives the packet and should forward it to PC1.<br>D.	The attacker manipulated R1's routing information, so R1 forwards the packet to R3.<br>E.	Router R3 knows better and sends the packet back to R1, thereby creating a loop.<br><br>Protecting Updates:<br>The diagram shows using the MD5 encryption algorithm to authenticate packets. A key (for example, cisco) and routing data are fed into the MD5 encryption algorithm to create a signature.<br><br>Operation:<br>The network topology is the same as the one for the attack animation, except that routers R2 and R3 are connected via a WAN link.<br>As the animation progresses:<br>A.	R3 sends an update and computed signature to R2.<br>B.	Router R2 receives the update and computes the signature.<br>C.	Router R1 then receives the update and also computes the signature.<br>D.	The routers compare signatures, and the routing updates are authenticated.<br>]]></content-text></brief>
