        <source>Desktop cases allow space conservation in tight areas because the monitor can be placed on top of unit. Tower cases can be located on or under the desk.

        <source>There are two main case models. One type is for desktop PCs, and the other type is for tower computers. The type of motherboard you choose determines the type of case that can be used. The size and shape must match exactly.</source>

        <source>For some people, how the case looks doesnâ€™t matter at all. For others, it is critical. There are many case designs to choose from if it is necessary to have a case that is attractive.</source>

      <trans-unit id="018" resname="IDS_TXT_14">
        <source>What is going on inside the case can be very important. LED indicators that are mounted on the front of the case can tell you if the system is receiving power, when the hard drive is being used, and when the computer is on standby or sleeping.</source>

      <trans-unit id="019" resname="IDS_TXT_15">
        <source>All cases have a vent on the power supply, and some have another vent on the back to help draw air into or out of the system. Some cases are designed with more vents in the event that the system needs a way to dissipate an unusual amount of heat. This situation may occur when many devices are installed close together in the case.</source>
